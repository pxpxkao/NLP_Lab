President Muhammadu Buhari has disclosed that Nigeria lost an estimated $ 157.5 billion to illicit financial flows between 2003 and 2012 . Mr Buhari quoted from the 2014 Global Financial Integrity Report in his address to the High-Level National Side-Event organised by the African Union Development Agency and New Partnership for Africa 's Development ( AUDA-NEPAD ) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC ) .
Citing tax avoidance as another form of illicit financial flow , he quoted the Tax Justice Network and the International Monetary Fund to have estimated over $ 200 billion per year as being lost by developing countries when multinational enterprises do not pay taxes in the countries where they made the profit .
If we get the tax structure right , this will … create thousands of jobs … help fund the State 's capital plan … and stop the flow of over $ 200 million in gaming revenue to Indiana .
The only sizable cash flow has gone to the Baltimore Casino Local Development Council ( BLDC ) , with the lion 's share of those funds paying for city services that chiefly benefit the casino . BLDC 's 2018 spending budget of $ 7.4 million , for example , includes more than $ 1.6 million for police protection around the casino , $ 358,000 for medic services , $ 435,000 for supplemental garbage collection , $ 540,000 to staff a mayoral employment center , and $ 2 million for infrastructure improvements around the casino .
In the '90s , Detroit built casinos to compete with those across the river in Windsor , Canada . Their revenue ended up accounting for 11 percent of the city 's budget , but it was n't enough to prevent the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history , in 2013 .
The city wants a 33-1/3 percent tax on Adjusted Gross Receipts ( the total earned from wagerers after prize money is doled out ) to pay for police and fire pensions . A study by the Illinois Gaming Board found that such a tax would only allow a casino to turn a 1 or 2 percent profit , which is not an acceptable rate of return for a casino operator .
