The Board is also popularising techniques like low frequency tapping ( including once-a -week tapping ) and controlled upward tapping to further improve production and bringing down the cost . The Board anticipates an annual production of 7.5 lakh tonne natural rubber this fiscal .
Timely rain-guarding has jacked up natural rubber output by 14,000 tonne in July , on an year-on-year basis , says Rubber Board .
The production recorded in July was 60,000 tonne , while it was 46,000 tonne in July 2018 . Confronted with a drastic reduction in production during the last few years , the Rubber Board companies procured rain-guard materials like polythene sheets and adhesive in bulk and distributed among small growers . As a result , nearly one lakh hactare of plantations were rain-guarded , more than the previous year .
For addressing this issue of unharvested plantations , the Rubber Board has recently introduced a programme , by which Board in association with its own companies and Rubber Producers ' Societies would adopt such untapped holdings of small holding farmers and arrange for the maintenance , tapping , processing and marketing of produce . Societies and companies have so far adopted 1,600 ha plantations during the last few months .
Contrary to popular perception , only about 18 percent of global goods trade is now driven by labor-cost arbitrage . Three factors explain these changes : growing demand in China and the rest of the developing world , which enables these countries to consume more of what they produce the growth of more comprehensive domestic supply chains in those countries , which has reduced their reliance on imports of intermediate goods and the impact of new technologies .
Exhibit 1 2 . Services play a growing and undervalued role in global value chains In 2017 , gross trade in services totaled $ 5.1 trillion , a figure dwarfed by the $ 17.3 trillion global goods trade . But trade in services has grown more than 60 percent faster than goods trade over the past decade ( Exhibit 2 ) .
Every day , users worldwide watch more than a billion hours of YouTube 's video content for free , and billions of people use Facebook and WeChat every month . These services undoubtedly create value for users , even without a monetary price . We estimate that these three channels collectively produce up to $ 8.3 trillion in value annually - a figure that would increase overall trade flows by $ 4.0 trillion ( or 20 percent ) and reallocate another $ 4.3 trillion currently counted as part of the flow of goods to services .
If we vary the ratio of GDP per capita of the exporter and importer from 2 to 10 , we find that labor-cost arbitrage ranges from 5 to 30 percent of overall global trade .
Moreover , the share of trade based on labor-cost arbitrage has been declining in some value chains , especially labor-intensive goods manufacturing ( where it dropped from 55 percent in 2005 to 43 percent in 2017 ) . This mainly reflects rising wages in developing countries .
The intraregional share of global goods trade has increased by 2.7 percentage points since 2013 , partially reflecting the rise of emerging-market consumption .
Previous MGI research highlighted China 's working-age population as one of the key global consumer segments by 2030 , they are projected to account for 12 cents of every $ 1 of worldwide urban consumption .
As it reaches the tipping point of having more millionaires than any other country in the world , China now represents roughly a third of the global market for luxury goods . In 2016 , 40 percent more cars were sold in China than in all of Europe , and China also accounts for 40 percent of global textiles and apparel consumption .
By 2017 , the share of exports was down to 9 percent . This is on a par with the share in the United States but is far lower than the shares in Germany ( 34 percent ) , South Korea ( 28 percent ) , and Japan ( 14 percent ) . This shift has been largely obscured because the country 's output , imports , and exports have all been rising so dramatically in absolute terms .
In 2002 , India , for example , exported 35 percent of its final output in apparel , but by 2017 , that share had fallen by half , to 17 percent , as Indian consumers stepped up purchases .
In textiles and apparel , for instance , production networks spanning multiple stages are consolidating within individual countries such as Vietnam , Bangladesh , Malaysia , India , and Indonesia . As a group , emerging Asia has become less reliant on imported intermediate inputs for the production of goods than the rest of the developing world ( 8.3 percent versus 15.1 percent in 2017 ) .
From 2005 to 2017 , the amount of cross-border bandwidth in use grew 148 times larger . A torrent of communications and content travels along these digital pathways - and some of this traffic reflects companies interacting with foreign operations , suppliers , and customers .
While many of those transactions may substitute for traditional offline trade flows , e-commerce could still spur some $ 1.3 trillion to $ 2.1 trillion in incremental trade by 2030 , boosting trade in manufactured goods by 6 to 10 percent .
0 Blockchain shipping solutions can reduce transit times and speed payments . We calculate that new logistics technologies could reduce shipping and customs processing times by 16 to 28 percent .

The academic literature finds that a 1 percent reduction in trade costs can result in a 0.4 percent increase in trade flows .
Companies in advanced economies are already automating some customer support services rather than offshoring them . This could reduce the $ 160 billion global market for business process outsourcing ( BPO ) , now one of the most heavily traded service sectors .
Overall , we estimate that automation , AI , and additive manufacturing could reduce global goods trade by up to 10 percent by 2030 , as compared to the baseline .
For example , McKinsey 's automotive practice estimates that electric vehicles will make up some 17 percent of total car sales globally by 2030 , up from 1 percent in 2017 . This could reduce trade in vehicle parts by up to 10 percent ( since EVs have many fewer moving parts than traditional models ) while also dampening oil imports .

The goal is to have a smaller bank , but with a more sustainable business model less dependent on capital markets in the long term . To achieve this , Deutsche Bank has decided to create a new Capital Release Unit ( CRU ) , to where it transferred some €74 billion ( $ 81 billion ) of risk-weighted assets ( RWAs ) and €288 billion ( $ 316 billion ) of leverage exposure .
Source : Deutsche Bank Its goal is to eliminate these assets from the bank 's balance sheet in a few years , which is expected to have restructuring costs of more than about €2 billion ( $ 2.2 billion ) in the next three years plus accounting charges ( non-cash expenses ) and liberate some €5 billion ( $ 5.5 billion ) of capital until 2022 .
Other key financial targets are for core revenue of €25 billion ( $ 27.5 billion ) in 2022 , adjusted costs of €17 billion ( $ 18.7 billion ) and a return on tangible equity ( RoTE ) of 8 % . This means that Deutsche Bank expects to increase revenue at about 2 % per year during 2019-2022 , reduce costs by 7 % per year and increase its profitability ( RoTE ) from only 0.5 % to a level much closer to its cost of capital .
In the short term , the restructuring program is expected to reduce Deutsche Bank 's fully loaded core tier 1 ( FL CET1 ) ratio to a level of about 13 % , which is still an adequate level .
Going forward , due to its less risky business profile , it targets a FL CET1 ratio of at least 12.5 % compared to 13 % previously .
Equities and fixed-income reported an 18 % decline in revenues compared to the same period of last year , showing that the bank 's strategy of reducing its exposure to investment banking is the right one , after several years trying to defend its position in this industry .
The bank targets a cost-to-income ratio of 70 % by 2022 by cutting some €6 billion ( $ 6.6 billion ) in annual expenses and some revenue growth , which should be the key to reach its profitability target in the medium term .
Due to one-off deferred tax assets ( DTA ) impairment of €2 billion ( $ 2.2 billion ) in the past quarter , Deutsche Bank 's reported bottom-line in Q2 2019 was negative in more than €3.1 billion ( $ 3.4 billion ) .

September 11 , 2019 Europe , Featured News , Switzerland Share Tweet Share Reddit WhatsApp By Davide Anghileri , University of Lausanne On 1 September , the voters of Switzerland 's canton of Zurich endorsed a cantonal tax reform bill with a 56 % majority as a consequence of the approval of the Swiss corporate tax reform in May .
The cantonal tax regimes such as holding company , mixed company , and domicile company are abolished . As a consequence of this abolition , specific transitional rules will be available for companies that will lose their preferential cantonal tax regimes . Hence , during a transition period of 5 years , the realization of hidden reserves ( including original goodwill ) can be taxed separately with a lower special tax rate of 0.5 % if such income would not have been taxable under the old law .
As of January 1 , 2021 , the corporate income tax rate will be reduced from the current 8 % to 7 % . As a result , the effective tax burden for an ordinarily taxed company in the canton of Zurich with domicile in the city of Zurich will be reduced from currently 21.1 % to 19.1 % ( federal , cantonal , and community tax calculation based on profit before taxes and current conditions ) .
Therefore , the maximum cantonal tax relief is set at 70 % . The capital tax on equity relating to investments , patents , and similar intangibles as well as intercompany loans will also be reduced under the Canton Zurich tax reform . Consequently , taxable equity attributable to qualifying investments , loans to group companies , and qualifying intellectual property will be reduced by 90 % . Researcher and lecturer at University of Lausanne Davide Anghileri is a PhD candidate at the University of Lausanne , where he is writing his thesis on the attribution of profits to PEs .

Profitability also has improved over the past decade as the company got larger and more efficient , reflected in its EBITDA margin that increased from levels of about 32 % in 2009 to a new record high of near 38 % in 2018 .
Its operating income was $ 1.8 billion , while net income decreased a little to $ 1.2 billion due to disposals .
This means that Fiserv 's free cash flow generation is very good , given that it has been above 100 % in the past two years due to its tech-oriented business with low need of fixed assets .
On the other hand , its adjusted operating margin declined by some 40 basis points ( bps ) and Fiserv 's free cash flow conversion was below 100 % , due to a decline in profitability at its Payments unit during the first quarter of 2019 .
Fiserv agreed back in January to buy First Data , an electronic payments processor , for about $ 22 billion in an all-stock transaction . This is one of the largest mergers in the financial industry in the past few months , creating one of the leading companies in the payments industry . The merger was recently closed and Fiserv shareholders own about 57.5 % of the new combined company , while First Data shareholders owning 42.5 % .
This means that integration risk is high and will change Fiserv 's business , with a significant exposure to the intensely competitive market of merchant-payments processing at about 38 % of combined revenue .
Fiserv believes that this business combination makes sense from the complementary assets between the two companies , projecting higher revenue growth than it would achieve on its own and costs savings of about $ 900 million over five years .
Moreover , even including this setback for Fiserv , it still expects at least 20 % adjusted EPS accretion in the first year and more than 40 % when First Data is fully integrated , showing the strong business and financial merits of this merger .

Convergence between poorer and richer countries comes to a halt In 2018 , gross financial assets in emerging markets not only declined for the first time , but the decline of -0.4 % was also more pronounced than in the industrialized countries ( -0.1 % ) . The weak development in China , where assets fell by 3.4 % , played a key role in this .
They increased by 22 % to more than EUR 2,700 billion .
The global debt ratio ( liabilities as a percentage of GDP ) , however , remained stable at 65.1 % , thanks to still robust economic growth .
In the last three years alone , the debt ratio jumped by almost ten percentage points , driven mainly by China ( +15 percentage points ) .
Because of the strong growth in liabilities , net financial assets i.e . the difference between gross financial assets and debt fell by 1.9 % to EUR 129.8 trillion at the close of 2018 . Emerging countries in particular suffered a drastic decline , net financial assets shrank by 5.7 % ( industrialized countries : -1.1 % ) .

When John places $ 100 in a safe deposit box with Bank One he does not relinquish his claim over the $ 100 .
Likewise , when he places $ 100 in a demand deposit at Bank One he also does not relinquish his claim over the deposited $ 100 .
By lending Mike $ 50 , the bank creates a deposit for $ 50 that Mike can now use .
According to the popular way of thinking , if the Fed injects $ 1 billion into the economy and banks have to hold only 10 % in reserves against their deposits , this will cause the first bank to lend 90 % of this $ 1 billion .
The $ 810 million will end up with a third bank , which in turn will lend out 90 % of $ 810 million and so on . Consequently , the initial injection of $ 1 billion will become $ 10 billion ( i.e. , the money supply will expand by a multiple of 10 ) .
Observe that banks respond to the initial injection of $ 1 billion by the Fed , which coupled with the legal reserve requirements of 10 % , sets in motion the monetary expansion of $ 10 billion .
Thus when John lends his $ 50 via Bank One to Mike the $ 50 is transferred to Mike from John .
If however , Bank One practices fractional-reserve banking and lends the $ 50 to Mike out of thin air , then on the day of maturity when Mike repays the $ 50 the money goes back to the bank - the original creator of this empty money , i.e. , money disappears from the economy , or it vanishes .

More than $ 190 million of the additional money requested would add nearly 1,900 teachers and give them $ 1,000 each -- -up from this year 's $ 600 -- -to support classroom and students needs .

Another big increase Mackey wants is in the amount of money called classroom instructional support that is given to teachers for materials for students and classrooms .

1 Analysts expect Lockheed Martin to report FY 2019 EPS of $ 21.21 and for FY 2020 EPS to come in at $ 25.36 . Over the next 5 years analysts expect Lockheed to show 14.5 % annual earnings growth . I then assumed that Lockheed would be able to grow earnings at 7.0 % per year for the following 5 years .
For dividend yield theory I consider the +/- 10 % band to be the fair value range for the business in question which in Lockheed Martin 's case would be $ 287- $ 352 . That suggests that shares have possible downside risk of 9 % -26 % .
Even looking at 13 % annualized returns , estimated earnings growth plus the dividend yield , you could still stomach roughly 20 % valuation compression to a 15x TTM P/E and still generate 13 % annualized returns . That 's pretty impressive and due in large part to the forecast growth of earnings .

September 18 , 2019 By : Spencer Israel Saturday 's drone strikes against Saudi Aramco oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais has given the oil market a shock the likes of which it has n't seen in years , and the ramifications are heavy . Five percent of the world 's daily oil output has been disrupted , or 5.7 million barrels/day , the biggest disruption in history ( and bigger than the 5.6 million b/d disruption during the Iranian Revolution of 1978-79 ) .
With half of Saudi Arabia 's oil production offline , oil had its biggest one-day gain since 2008 on Monday , and for a lucky few traders who owned the October $ 60 call options in WTI futures , their previously worthless contracts were suddenly worth $ 24 million , per Bloomberg , and the spread between Brent and WTI futures widened by as much as 37 % .
Goldman Sachs estimated that if oil production remained down for more than six weeks , Brent futures would likely rally to $ 75 per barrel .
Financial Ombudsman Service By Imogen Tew Intrinsic has been forced to compensate Harlequin clients three times in the past year after the Financial Ombudsman Service found its representatives had given unsuitable mortgage advice to those investing in the troubled overseas property group .
Around 6,000 mainly British investors ploughed about £400m into the unregulated overseas property scheme through UK financial advisers and many released cash from their homes to fund the investment . Such consumers were hoping for 'guaranteed returns ' of 10 per cent a year from luxury villas that never came as the company entered insolvency in 2016 and subsequently went bankrupt .
The ombudsman said the adviser would have been aware Harlequin was the reason Mr and Mrs A sought the new mortgage and would have known the nature of Harlequin as a risky investment . Although the ombudsman service noted the adviser was not giving investment advice , they said the adviser should have thought about how the mortgage was to be repaid and that the nature of the investment should have raised concerns as to the security of the repayment strategy . In this case , Intrinsic Mortgage Planning was ordered to pay the difference between the total cost of the interest-only mortgage and what the total cost of the repayment vehicle would have been - plus 8 per cent simple interest per year and £750 for trouble and upset .

( AP Photo/Michael Sohn ) By GREGORY KATZ Associated Press | Posted : Sun 10:05 PM , Sep 22 , 2019 | Updated : Mon 3:09 AM , Sep 23 , 2019 LONDON ( AP ) - British tour company Thomas Cook collapsed early Monday after failing to secure emergency funding , leaving tens of thousands of vacationers stranded abroad .
The Civil Aviation Authority said Thomas Cook has ceased trading , its four airlines will be grounded , and its 21,000 employees in 16 countries , including 9,000 in the U.K. , will lose their jobs .
The company had said Friday it was seeking 200 million pounds ( $ 250 million ) to avoid going bust and was in weekend talks with shareholders and creditors to stave off failure .

To achieve this dividend income in time for my retirement , the portfolio must grow with an organic dividend income of 8 % YoY and cash contributions must grow 4 % annually .
Based on current balances , if I were to retire today ( I know that I can not for a number of reasons ! ) , we would have 25 % of our assets without tax exposure ( Roth ) , 20 % subject to the long-term capital gains tax , and 55 % taxable at normal income tax levels .
To limit the effect of a protracted bear market in any one industry , I aim to keep the dividend income and portfolio value for each industry under 20 % .
Due to the relatively low valuations in the healthcare space , namely the drug development companies of AbbVie ( NYSE : ABBV ) , Gilead Sciences ( NASDAQ : GILD ) , and Amgen ( NASDAQ : AMGN ) , I have added to these positions and allowed the dividend income to slightly exceed the 20 % limit .
On the opposite end , due to the significant growth in consumer discretionary stocks such as Apple ( OTC : APPL ) and Disney ( NYSE : DIS ) , this sector has breached 20 % of the total portfolio value .
If this cash flow materializes , I will have exceeded both the modeled target dividend income of $ 7,746 and the stretch goal of $ 8,700 targeted at the beginning of 2019 .
Further , this 2019 achievement will set us up to breach the $ 10,000 dividend mark in 2020 .
Since my target organic DGR is 8 % , I am reassured to see the average DGR of the Roth and Traditional is ~8 % .
The DGR in the Roth is lower at 5.4 % due primarily to its holding of REITs .
We Company plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq sometime within the next few weeks , even though it reportedly may be forced to slash its valuation by more than half to perhaps as low as $ 10 billion .

For a number of practical reasons , it is very difficult to keep an insolvent airline 's planes servicing routes . Consequently , Monarch 's administration left hundreds of thousands of passengers stranded overseas , and left taxpayers with an estimated £60m repatriation bill .

What happened was an unfortunate coincidence - just as companies were withdrawing cash from money markets to pay corporate tax , a glut of new bonds appeared on the market as the U.S. government sold some $ 78 billion of 10- and 30-year debt last week . With just $ 24 billion of bonds maturing in the period , this became one of three occasions this year when the imbalance between debt redemption and cash needed to buy new Treasuries exceeded $ 50 billion .
Suddenly there was a scarcity of dollars at the same time as a glut of Treasuries , which banks typically lend out to investors with spare cash through repurchase agreement . As a result , the overnight repo rate more than doubled to 4.75 % , the highest level since December , according to ICAP pricing .

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has slammed GM GM , -0.01 % as during a time of what she called record profits , specifically after the auto maker said it would suspend payments for strikers ' health insurance .
But it 's actually down about 36 % from $ 10.6 billion in 2016 - and the company lost $ 3.9 billion in net income in 2017 , when it had an unusually big tax bill .
And there is a simple reason for that : The company has spent $ 25 billion to $ 27 billion a year since 2015 on capital expenditures - which are n't immediately deducted from earnings .
On the other hand , the production workers have a point : They did sacrifice when the company was on the ropes in 2009 and do deserve to claw some of those concessions back now that the company 's condition has normalized . Back then , the United Auto Workers agreed to let the company pay new assembly-line hires about half of the previous rate ( $ 15 versus $ 29 per hour ) , which previous hires kept earning .

Mr Lee says : What follows though is good example of what goes wrong when a local council gets involved with market forces it does n't fully understand . The original proposals to restore and create the flats on the upper floors were very expensive with the total refurbishment costing £757,000 or £126,000 per flat , despite the whole building being only worth around £500,000 .
Now , just a few months later the plans have come back , the only real change is an adjustment to the cost which has now climbed to a staggering £846,000 for the refurbishment or £141,000 per flat .
They anticipate making only £1,971 profit a year which equates to less than 0.25 per cent profit a year on the costs of the refurbishment and as usual the council have not allowed for void periods or repairs to the building over the 40-year life of the loan .
She also noted a new program which will provides a one-time grant of up to $ 50,000 to fund projects such as needle distribution and recovery programs .

The percentage of companies offering paid maternity leave , for example , increased from 26 percent in 2016 to 35 percent in 2018 .

NEW DELHI : With a lower tax rate for new manufacturers , the government is looking to attract investment flowing out of China following its trade dispute with the US , but experts say India needs to also remove other major obstacles for multinationals to consider it as an alternative destination to the neighbouring country . The 15 % rate - 17 % after including a cess and surcharge - that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced on Friday is among the lowest in South and Southeast Asia .
Bringing down the corporate tax rate to 15 % for new manufacturing is a deep cut . In the medium term it will be one of the major consideration for companies to shift base from China to India , said DK Joshi , principal economist at Crisil .
Finance minister Sitharaman said the government would allow any new domestic company incorporated on or after October 1 , 2019 and making fresh investment in manufacturing to pay income tax at 15 % as well as exemptions from the minimum alternate tax , provided it did not avail of any exemption or incentive and commences production by March 31 , 2023 .
Adding the cess and surcharge , the effective tax rate for these companies will be 17.01 % .

PANAJI , India ( Reuters ) - India 's government slashed corporate taxes on Friday , giving a surprise $ 20.5 billion break aimed at reviving private investment and lifting growth from a six-year low that has caused job losses and fueled discontent in the countryside .
She lowered effective corporate tax further for domestic firms incorporated on or after Oct. 1 to 17 % , with the condition that they begin production by March 2023 .
The step to cut corporate tax is historic . It will give a great stimulus to # MakeInIndia , attract private investment from across the globe , improve competitiveness of our private sector , create more jobs and result in a win-win for 1.30 billion Indians , he said on Twitter .
Indian shares surged more than 6 % and were set for their best day in more than a decade after the government announced the tax cuts to revive flagging growth in Asia 's third largest economy .
While shares soared , bond yields spiked to a near three-month high on speculation that the government may have to borrow more to meet its expenditure needs for the year , as the measures will mean a revenue loss of 1.45 trillion rupees for the current year .
The risk of missing its fiscal deficit target of 3.3 % increases significantly as tax revenue growth is already weak .

Donald Trump , on the other hand , wants to give corporations and the richest 1 percent more tax breaks to keep goosing a lopsided economic boom - even as deficit hawks moan about the exploding national debt and annual deficits topping $ 1 trillion .
This 0.1 percent includes households with incomes over $ 2.4 million , and wealth starting at $ 32 million . They own more wealth than the bottom 80 percent combined .
One way to ensure that the wealthy pay first is to institute a 10 percent surtax on incomes over $ 2 million .
The surtax would apply to income earned from work ( wages and salaries ) and to investment income gained from wealth , including capital gains and dividends . So those with capital income over $ 2 million would not get a preferential tax rate .

But the outbreak of financial tension put a new set of issues in play , prompting the New York Fed on Tuesday and Wednesday to pump up to $ 150 billion into the U.S. money market after the costs for securing overnight repurchase agreements spiked .
A rate cut on Wednesday would lower the Fed 's target policy rate to a range of between 1.75 % and 2.00 % and dovetail with moves by central banks around the world to ease monetary policy to offset the impact of a U.S.-China trade war and other risks to the global economy .
The Fed absolutely lost control over the fed funds rate , said Gennadiy Goldberg , senior rates strategist at TD Securities , noting that the 2.3 % effective rate reflected Tuesday 's blow-up in the repo market , and adding that the New York Fed 's measures since then , including its liquidity injection Wednesday , have probably brought the rate back into line .

Almost everything that was lagging has now rallied and almost everything that was doing well has been hurt , Baird strategist Willie Delwiche said in an interview with Business Insider .

FM Nirmala Sitharaman Notwithstanding its acute budget constraints , the government on Friday went the whole hog and unveiled a massive fiscal stimulus of Rs 1.45 lakh crore or 0.7 % of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , mostly in the form of surprise , more-than-asked-for tax cuts for the whole of corporate India . Hitherto , the government has been trying to spur the lethargic economy via easing of credit flows , making loans cheaper and bolstering liquidity across the financial-sector entities , rather than via a potentially hazardous fiscal digression .
Analysts estimate the steepest corporate tax cuts in nearly three decades , announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman here , would provide a direct cash booster of 10 % of profit before tax ( PBT ) for most domestic companies across all sectors above an annual turnover of Rs 400 crore for those below this size ( 99.3 % of the firms registered ) , the reduction in the tax rate will be roughly 4 percentage points .
Friday 's package also opened a legit facility for companies to reduce the tax incidence on part-business by a dream-like 20 % of PBT by using a new benign effective rate of 17 % announced for those making fresh investments in manufacturing .
The largesse has met the long-standing demand from the industry for the headline corporate tax rate comparable to the Asian peers ( see chart ) , but it widened the tax disparity between domestic and foreign companies with branch operations here , the larger ones of which are under a rate of 44 % .
For sure , the steps , aimed at creating a virtuous cycle of investments , will disturb the Centre 's fiscal maths in a big way and will necessitate a major reformulation of the medium-term fiscal glide path , as per which the fiscal deficit is to be 3.3 % of GDP in FY20 and the FRBM-mandated 3 % in FY21 .
0 Ceteris paribus , the fiscal deficit this fiscal will widen to around 4 % owing to the stimulus if extra transfers from RBI are counted , the deficit 's size could be 3.8 % .
1 Ceteris paribus , the fiscal deficit this fiscal will widen to around 4 % owing to the stimulus if extra transfers from RBI are counted , the deficit 's size could be 3.8 % .
To be sure , domestic companies will have now the option of paying tax on their income effective FY20 at 22 % ( 25.17 % including surcharge and cess ) or pay the 30 % rate ( 34.94 % ) and avail themselves of assorted incentives to reduce the actual tax incidence .
Only during the Great Recession of 2008 did earnings decline -18 % .
If over the course of the next 10 years , the P/E were to revert to 27.91 and everything else was held equal , it would produce a 10-year CAGR of about -1.54 % . Business/Shareholder Yield There are four components to the business/shareholder yield : the dividend yield , the expected buyback yield , the portion of the earnings yield that the business keeps to reinvest itself , and the full-cycle earnings growth rate .
Data by YCharts The way I think about this is that if I could theoretically buy Starbucks ' business for $ 100 , I would earn $ 3.13 on that investment the first year .
They deduced their shares outstanding by -8.56 % this past year . Since their earnings yield has only averaged about 4 % over this period , it is pretty clear that they are borrowing money to buy back shares .
If we assume that market sentiment reverts to the mean from the last cycle over the next 10 years , Starbucks will produce a -1.54 % CAGR .
If the business/shareholder yield and growth are similar to the last cycle , Starbucks should produce a +5.63 % 10-year CAGR .
If the stock price at that point reverts to its mean , it would lose about -14 % of its value and produce a price of $ 100.84 .
But if we were to have an actual recession , this is a stock that traded at nearly a 12 P/E during the last recession . That sort of move would imply a -60 % drawdown , not the -14 % drawdown I assumed above based on the average P/E .
My expectation is that owners would be able to increase the number of Starbucks shares they own by 20-25 % using this strategy without spending any additional money .
