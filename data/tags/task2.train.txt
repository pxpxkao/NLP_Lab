The C

the C

and C

anticipates E
an E
annual E
production E
of E
7.5 E
lakh E
tonne E
natural E
rubber E
this E
fiscal E
. E

Timely C

14,000 E
tonne E
in E
July E
, E
on E
an E
year-on-year E
basis E
, E
says E
Rubber E
Board E
. E

The C
production C
recorded C
in C
July C
was C
60,000 C
tonne C
, C
while C
it C
was C
46,000 C
tonne C
in C
July C
2018 C
. C
Confronted C
with C
a C
drastic C
reduction C
in C
production C
during C
the C
last C
few C
years C
, C
the C
Rubber C
Board C
companies C
procured C
rain-guard C
materials C
like C
polythene C
sheets C
and C
adhesive C
in C
bulk C
and C
distributed C
among C
small C
growers C
. C
As E
a E
result E
, E
nearly E
one E
lakh E
hactare E
of E
plantations E
were E
rain-guarded E
, E
more E
than E
the E
previous E
year E
. E

For C
addressing C
this C
issue C
of C
unharvested C
plantations C
, C
the C
Rubber C
Board C
has C
recently C
introduced C
a C
programme C
, C
by C
which C
Board C
in C
association C
with C
its C
own C
companies C
and C
Rubber C
Producers C
' C
Societies C
would C
adopt C
such C
untapped C
holdings C
of C
small C
holding C
farmers C
and C
arrange C
for C
the C
maintenance C
, C
tapping C
, C
processing C
and C
marketing C
of C
produce C
. C
Societies E
and E
companies E
have E
so E
far E
adopted E
1,600 E
ha E
plantations E
during E
the E
last E
few E
months E
. E

Contrary E
to E
popular E
perception E
, E
only E
about E
18 E
percent E
of E
global E
goods E
trade E
is E
now E
driven E
by E
labor-cost E
arbitrage E
. E
Three C
factors C
explain C
these C
changes C
: C
growing C
demand C
in C
China C
and C
the C
rest C
of C
the C
developing C
world C
, C
which C
enables C
these C
countries C
to C
consume C
more C
of C
what C
they C
produce C
the C
growth C
of C
more C
comprehensive C
domestic C
supply C
chains C
in C
those C
countries C
, C
which C
has C
reduced C
their C
reliance C
on C
imports C
of C
intermediate C
goods C
and C
the C
impact C
of C
new C
technologies C
. C

Exhibit E

. E
Services E
play E
a E
growing E
and E
undervalued E
role E
in E
global E
value E
chains E
In E
2017 E
, E
gross E
trade E
in E
services E
totaled E
$ E
5.1 E
trillion E
, E
a E
figure E
dwarfed E
by E
the E
$ E
17.3 E
trillion E
global E
goods E
trade E
. E
But C
trade C
in C
services C
has C
grown C
more C
than C
60 C
percent C
faster C
than C
goods C
trade C
over C
the C
past C
decade C
( C
Exhibit C

Every C

, C

watch C
more C
than C
a C

content C
for C

, C
and C
billions C
of C
people C
use C
Facebook C

every C
month C
. C
These _
services _
undoubtedly _
create _
value _
for _
users _
, _
even _
without _
a _
monetary _
price _
. _
We E
estimate E
that E
these E
three E
channels E
collectively E
produce E
up E
to E
$ E
8.3 E
trillion E
in E
value E
annually E
- E
a E
figure E
that E
would E
increase E
overall E
trade E
flows E
by E
$ E
4.0 E
trillion E
( E
or E
20 E
percent E
) E
and E
reallocate E
another E

counted E
as E
part E
of E
the E
flow E
of E
goods E
to E

. E

If C
we C
vary C
the C
ratio C
of C
GDP C
per C
capita C
of C
the C
exporter C
and C
importer C
from C
2 C
to C
10 C
, _
we E
find E
that E
labor-cost E
arbitrage E
ranges E
from E
5 E
to E
30 E
percent E
of E
overall E
global E
trade E
. E

Moreover E
, E
the E
share E
of E
trade E
based E
on E
labor-cost E
arbitrage E
has E
been E
declining E
in E
some E
value E
chains E
, E
especially E
labor-intensive E

The E

increased E
by E

of C
the C
key C
global C
consumer C

are E
projected E

account E
for E

As C

reaches C
the C
tipping C
point C
of C
having C
more C
millionaires C
than C
any C
other C
country C
in C
the C
world C
, C
China C
now C
represents C
roughly C
a C
third C
of C
the C
global C
market C
for C
luxury C
goods C
. C
In E
2016 E
, E
40 E
percent E
more E
cars E
were E
sold E
in E
China E
than E
in E
all E
of E

, E
and E
China E
also E
accounts E
for E
40 E
percent E
of E
global E
textiles E
and E

consumption E
. E

By E
2017 E
, E
the E
share E
of E
exports E
was E
down E
to E
9 E
percent E
. E
This _
is _
on _
a _
par _
with _
the _
share _
in _
the _
United _

but _
is _
far _
lower _
than _
the _

in _

( _

( _

) _
, _
and _

( _

This C
shift C
has C
been C
largely C
obscured C
because C
the C
country C
's C
output C
, C
imports C
, C
and C
exports C
have C
all C
been C
rising C
so C
dramatically C
in C
absolute C
terms C
. C

In E
2002 E
, E
India E
, E
for E

, E
exported E
35 E
percent E
of E
its E
final E
output E
in E
apparel E
, E
but E
by E
2017 E
, E
that E
share E
had E
fallen E
by E
half E
, E
to E
17 E
percent E
, E
as _
Indian C
consumers C
stepped C
up C

As E

emerging E
Asia E
has E
become E
less E
reliant E
on E

intermediate E
inputs E
for E
the E

Companies C

we C
estimate C

could E
reduce E

up E

For C

McKinsey C

estimates C
that C
electric C

will C
make C
up C
some C
17 C
percent C

sales C
globally C
by C
2030 C
, C
up C
from C
1 C
percent C
in C
2017 C
. C
This E
could E
reduce E
trade E
in E
vehicle E
parts E
by E
up E
to E
10 E
percent E
( E
since E

September E

the E
voters E
of E
Switzerland E
's E
canton E
of E
Zurich E
endorsed E
a E
cantonal E
tax E
reform E
bill E
with E
a E
56 E
% E
majority E
as _
a _
consequence _
of _
the C
approval C
of C
the C
Swiss C
corporate C
tax C
reform C
in C
May C
. C

The C
cantonal C
tax C
regimes C
such C
as C
holding C
company C
, C
mixed C
company C
, C
and C
domicile C
company C
are C
abolished C
. C
As _
a _
consequence _
of _
this _
abolition _
, _
specific _
transitional _
rules _
will _
be _
available _
for _
companies _
that _
will _
lose _
their _
preferential _
cantonal _
tax _
regimes _
. _
Hence E
, E
during E
a E

period E

5 E
years E
, E
the E
realization E
of E
hidden E
reserves E
( E
including E

can E
be E
taxed E
separately E
with E
a E
lower E
special E
tax E
rate E
of E
0.5 E
% E
if E
such E
income E
would E
not E
have E
been E
taxable E
under E
the E
old E
law E
. E

As C
of C
January C
1 C
, C
2021 C
, C
the C
corporate C
income C
tax C
rate C
will C
be C
reduced C
from C
the C
current C
8 C
% C
to C
7 C
% C
. C
As E
a E
result E
, E
the E
effective E
tax E

for E
an E
ordinarily E
taxed E
company E
in E
the E
canton E
of E
Zurich E
with E
domicile E
in E
the E
city E

will E
be E
reduced E
from E
currently E
21.1 E
% E

, E
and E

Therefore C

Many E
companies E
have E
stopped E
expansion E

are E
reaching E
out E
to E
tax E
experts E
after E
the E
corporate E
tax E
for E
new E
companies E
has E
been E
pegged E
at E
15 E
% E
. E
The C
reason C
being C
that C
instead C
of C
investing C
directly C
, C
if C
a C
separate C
entity C
is C
formed C
for C
the C
same C
investment C
, C
there C
could C
be C
a C
tax C
arbitrage C
of C
about C
10 C
% C
. C

While E
companies E
can E
avail E
15 E
% E
tax E
rate E
by _
making C
capital C
expenditure C
through C
a C
new C
legal C
entity C
, C
they C
have C
to C
be C
mindful C
that C
this C
is C
not C
a C
restructuring C
and C
even C
the C
new C
company C
should C
n't C
have C
borrowed C
money C
from C
existing C

This E
means E
that E
Fiserv E

good E
, E
given E
that E
it E
has E
been E
above E

This _

one _

, _
creating _

The E

the E
new E
combined E
company E
, E
while E
First E
Data E
shareholders E
owning E
42.5 E

. E

This C
means C
that C
integration C
risk C
is C
high C
and _
will E
change E
Fiserv E
's E
business E
, E
with E
a E
significant E
exposure E
to E
the E
intensely E
competitive E
market E
of E
merchant-payments E
processing E
at E
about E
38 E
% E
of E
combined E
revenue E
. E

Fiserv C
believes C
that C
this C
business C
combination C
makes C
sense C
from C
the C
complementary C
assets C
between C
the C
two C
companies C
, _
projecting E
higher E
revenue E
growth E
than E
it E
would E
achieve E
on E

own E
and E

about E

900 E

over E
five E
years E

Moreover E

even E

this E
setback E
for E
Fiserv E
, E
it E
still E
expects E
at E
least E
20 E

David E

a C
stunning C
11.5 C

return C
in C
the C
year C
to C
June C
2019 C
, C
eclipsing C
the C
performance C
of C
most C
top C

. C

When C
John C
places C
$ C
100 C
in C
a C
safe C
deposit C
box C
with C
Bank C
One C
he E
does E
not E
relinquish E
his E
claim E
over E
the E
$ E
100 E
. E

Likewise C
, C
when C
he C
places C
$ C
100 C
in C
a C
demand C
deposit C
at C
Bank C
One C
he E
also E
does E
not E
relinquish E
his E
claim E
over E
the E
deposited E
$ E
100 E
. E

By C
lending C
Mike C
$ C
50 C
, _
the E
bank E
creates E
a E
deposit E
for E
$ E
50 E
that E
Mike E
can E
now E
use E
. E

According C
to C
the C
popular C
way C
of C
thinking C
, C
if C
the C
Fed C
injects C
$ C
1 C
billion C
into C
the C
economy C
and C
banks C
have C
to C
hold C
only C
10 C
% C
in C
reserves C
against C
their C
deposits C
, _
this _
will _
cause _
the E
first E
bank E
to E
lend E
90 E
% E
of E
this E
$ E
1 E
billion E
. E

The C
$ C
810 C
million C
will C
end C
up C
with C
a C
third C
bank C
, C
which C
in C
turn C
will C
lend C
out C
90 C
% C
of C
$ C
810 C
million C
and C
so C
on C
. C
Consequently E
, E
the E
initial E
injection E
of E
$ E
1 E
billion E
will E
become E
$ E
10 E
billion E
( E
i.e. E
, E
the E
money E
supply E
will E
expand E
by E
a E
multiple E
of E
10 E
) E
. E

Observe C
that C
banks C
respond C
to C
the C
initial C
injection C
of C
$ C
1 C
billion C
by C
the C
Fed C
, C
which C
coupled C
with C
the C
legal C
reserve C
requirements C
of C
10 C
% C
, _
sets _
in _
motion _
the E
monetary E
expansion E
of E
$ E
10 E
billion E
. E

Thus C
when C
John C
lends C
his C
$ C
50 C
via C
Bank C
One C
to C
Mike C
the E
$ E
50 E
is E
transferred E
to E
Mike E
from E
John E
. E

If C
however C
, C
Bank C
One C
practices C
fractional-reserve C
banking C
and C
lends C
the C
$ C
50 C
to C
Mike C
out C
of C
thin C
air C
, _
then E
on E
the E
day E
of E
maturity E
when E
Mike E
repays E
the E
$ E
50 E
the E
money E
goes E
back E
to E
the E
bank E
- E
the E
original E
creator E
of E
this E
empty E
money E
, E
i.e. E
, E
money E
disappears E
from E
the E
economy E
, E
or E
it E
vanishes E

Aside C
from C
the C

tragedy C

we C
saw C
in C

after C

our E

fall E
by E

Amplify E
had E
some E
90 E

tied E

when E

now E
the E
goal E
is E
to E
whittle E
that E
down E
to E
about E

so _
it C
's C
more C
manageable C
, C
better C
integrated C
, C
and C
easier C
for C
everyone C
to C
learn C
. C

We E
decided E
that E
, E
an E
application E
that E
meets E
80 E
% E
to E
90 E
% E
of E
need E
, E
but E
maybe E
slightly E
short E
of E
best-in-breed E
, E
but E
integrates E
better E
, E
is E
just E
a E
better E
long-term E
solution E
for E
us E
, _
easier C
to C
manage C
, C
probably C
lower C
cost C
, C
and C
hopefully C
, C
since C
it C

integrated C

easier C
to C
use C
for C

if C

you C

To C
achieve C
this C

, _
the E

Based C
on C

, C
if C
I C
were C
to C
retire C
today C
( C
I C
know C
that C
I C
can C
not C
for C

number C

, _
we E

( E

, E
20 E

subject E

, E
and E

. E

To C
limit C
the C
effect C
of C
a C
protracted C
bear C
market C
in C
any C
one C
industry C
, _
I E
aim E
to E
keep E
the E
dividend E
income E
and E
portfolio E
value E
for E
each E
industry E
under E
20 E
% E
. E

Due C
to C
the C
relatively C
low C
valuations C
in C
the C
healthcare C
space C
, C
namely C
the C
drug C
development C
companies C
of C
AbbVie C

( C

, C
and C
Amgen C
( C
NASDAQ C
: C
AMGN C
) C
, _
I E
have E
added E
to E
these E
positions E
and E
allowed E
the E
dividend E
income E
to E
slightly E
exceed E
the E
20 E
% E
limit E
. E

On C
the C
opposite C
end C
, C
due C
to C
the C
significant C
growth C
in C
consumer C
discretionary C
stocks C
such C
as C
Apple C
( C
OTC C
: C
APPL C
) C
and C
Disney C
( C
NYSE C
: C
DIS C
) C
, _
this E
sector E
has E
breached E
20 E
% E
of E
the E
total E
portfolio E
value E
. E

If C
this C
cash C
flow C
materializes C
, _
I E
will E
have E
exceeded E
both E
the E
modeled E
target E
dividend E
income E
of E
$ E
7,746 E
and E
the E
stretch E
goal E
of E
$ E
8,700 E
targeted E
at E
the E
beginning E
of E
2019 E
. E

Further C
, C
this C
2019 C
achievement C
will _
set _
us E
up E
to E
breach E
the E
$ E
10,000 E
dividend E
mark E
in E
2020 E
. E

Since C
my C
target C
organic C
DGR C
is C
8 C
% C
, _
I E
am E
reassured E
to E
see E
the E
average E
DGR E
of E
the E
Roth E
and E
Traditional E
is E
~8 E
% E
. E

The E
DGR E
in E
the E
Roth E
is E
lower E
at E
5.4 E
% E
due _
primarily _
to _
its C
holding C
of C
REITs C
. C

We C
Company C
plans C
to C
list C
its C

on C
the C

sometime C

even _
though _

a C

wrong C
when C
a C
local C
council C
gets C
involved C

it C
does C
n't C
fully C
understand C
. C
The E
original E
proposals E
to E
restore E
and E
create E
the E
flats E
on E
the E
upper E
floors E
were E
very E
expensive E
with E
the E
total E
refurbishment E
costing E
£757,000 E
or E
£126,000 E
per E
flat E
, E
despite E
the E
whole E
building E
being E
only E
worth E
around E
£500,000 E
. E

Now E
, E
just E
a E
few E
months E
later E
the E
plans E
have E
come E
back E
, E
the E
only E
real E
change E
is E
an E
adjustment E
to E
the E
cost E
which E
has E
now E
climbed E
to E
a E
staggering E
£846,000 E
for _
the C
refurbishment C
or C
£141,000 C
per C
flat C
. C

They C
anticipate C
making C
only C
£1,971 C
profit C
a C
year C
which _
equates _
to _
less E
than E
0.25 E
per E
cent E
profit E
a E
year E
on E
the E
costs E
of E
the E
refurbishment E
and E
as E
usual E
the E
council E
have E
not E
allowed E
for E
void E
periods E
or E
repairs E
to E
the E
building E
over E
the E
40-year E
life E
of E
the E
loan E
. E

She E
also E
noted E
a E
new E
program E
which E
will E
provides E
a E
one-time E
grant E
of E
up E
to E
$ E
50,000 E
to _
fund C
projects C
such C
as C
needle C

programs C

, C

An C

Notwithstanding E
its E
acute E
budget E
constraints E
, E
the E
government E
on E
Friday E
went E
the E
whole E
hog E
and E
unveiled E
a E
massive E
fiscal E
stimulus E
of E
Rs E
1.45 E
lakh E
crore E
or E
0.7 E
% E
of E
the E
gross E
domestic E
product E
( E

) E
, E
mostly E
in E
the E
form E
of E
surprise E
, E
more-than-asked-for E
tax E
cuts E
for E
the E
whole E
of E
corporate E
India E
. E
Hitherto C
, C
the C
government C
has C
been C
trying C
to C
spur C
the C
lethargic C
economy C
via C
easing C
of C
credit C
flows C
, C
making C
loans C
cheaper C
and C
bolstering C
liquidity C
across C
the C
financial-sector C
entities C
, C
rather C
than C
via C
a C
potentially C
hazardous C
fiscal C
digression C
. C

Analysts C
estimate C
the C
steepest C
corporate C
tax C
cuts C
in C
nearly C
three C
decades C
, C
announced C
by C
finance C
minister C
Nirmala C
Sitharaman C
here C
, _
would _
provide _
a E
direct E
cash E
booster E
of E
10 E
% E
of E
profit E
before E
tax E
( E
PBT E
) E
for E
most E
domestic E
companies E
across E
all E

400 E
crore E
for E
those E
below E
this E
size E
( E
99.3 E
% E
of E
the E
firms E
registered E
) E
, E
the E
reduction E
in E
the E
tax E
rate E
will E
be E
roughly E
4 E
percentage E
points E
. E

Friday E
's E
package E
also E
opened E
a E
legit E
facility E
for E
companies E
to E
reduce E
the E
tax E
incidence E
on E
part-business E
by E
a E
dream-like E
20 E
% E
of E
PBT E
by _
using C
a C
new C
benign C
effective C
rate C
of C
17 C
% C
announced C
for C
those C
making C
fresh C
investments C
in C
manufacturing C
. C

The C
largesse C
has C
met C
the C
long-standing C
demand C
from C
the C
industry C
for C
the C
headline C
corporate C
tax C
rate C
comparable C
to C
the C
Asian C
peers C
( C
see C
chart C
) C
, _
but _
it E
widened E
the E
tax E
disparity E
between E
domestic E
and E
foreign E
companies E
with E
branch E
operations E
here E
, E
the E
larger E
ones E
of E
which E
are E
under E
a E
rate E
of E
44 E
% E

For C
sure C
, C
the C
steps C
, C
aimed C
at C
creating C
a C
virtuous C
cycle C
of C
investments C
, _
will E
disturb E
the E
Centre E
's E
fiscal E
maths E
in E
a E
big E
way E
and E
will E
necessitate E
a E
major E
reformulation E
of E

medium-term E
fiscal E
glide E
path E
, E
as E
per E
which E
the E
fiscal E
deficit E
is E
to E
be E
3.3 E

of E

in E
FY20 E
and E
the E
FRBM-mandated E

in E

[SEP0] _
Ceteris E

, E
the E
fiscal E
deficit E
this E

will E
widen E
to E
around E

to _
the C

if _
extra _

are _
counted _

The C
way C
I C
think C
about C
this C
is C
that C
if C
I C
could C
theoretically C
buy C
Starbucks C
' C
business C
for C
$ C
100 C
, _
I E
would E
earn E
$ E
3.13 E
on E
that E
investment E

first E
year E
. E

They E
deduced E
their E
shares E
outstanding E
by E
-8.56 E
% E
this E
past E
year E
. E
Since C
their C
earnings C
yield C
has C
only C
averaged C
about C
4 C
% C
over C
this C
period C
, C
it C
is C
pretty C
clear C
that C
they C
are C
borrowing C
money C
to C
buy C
back C
shares C
. C

If C
we C
assume C
that C
market C
sentiment C
reverts C
to C
the C
mean C
from C
the C
last C
cycle C
over C
the C
next C
10 C
years C
, _
Starbucks E
will E
produce E
a E
-1.54 E
% E
CAGR E
. E

If C
the C
business/shareholder C
yield C
and C
growth C
are C
similar C
to C
the C
last C
cycle C
, _
Starbucks E
should E
produce E
a E
+5.63 E
% E
10-year E
CAGR E
. E

If C
the C
stock C
price C
at C
that C
point C
reverts C
to C
its C
mean C
, _
it E
would E
lose E
about E
-14 E
% E
of E
its E
value E
and E
produce E
a E
price E
of E
$ E
100.84 E
. E

But C
if C
we C
were C
to C
have C
an C
actual C
recession C
, C
this C
is C
a C
stock C
that C
traded C
at C
nearly C
a C
12 C
P/E C
during C
the C
last C
recession C
. C
That E
sort E
of E
move E
would E
imply E
a E

, E
not E
the E
-14 E

I E
assumed E

based E
on E

My E
expectation E
is E
that E

would E
be E
able E
to E
increase E
the E
number E
of E
Starbucks E

they E
own E
