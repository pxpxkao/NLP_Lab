Analysis E

MRMD E

Condensed E

Statements E
of E
Operations E
As E
the E
above E
data E
indicates E
, E
the E
company E
's E
gross E
margin E
decreased E
significantly E
from E
60 E
% E
in E
Q1 E
to E
~35 E
% E
in E
Q2 E
. E
The C
reason C
for C
this C
decline C
of C
40+ C
% C
is C
due C
to C
the C
~83 C
% C
o C
f C
Q2 C
sales C
that C
were C
from C

were C
at C
a C
much C
lower C
margin C

However C
, C
since C
MRMD C
has C
said C
that C

expects C

in C

, _
I E
believe E
that E
the E

due E
from E
GenCanna E
is E
essentially E
a E
timing E
difference E
of E
no E
undue E

So _
that _

Certainly C
, C
a C
catalyst C
would C
have C
been C
the C

collapse C
, C
but C
it C
's C
more C
about C
investor C
decisions C
to C
allocate C
capital C
to C
a C
sector C
that C
has C
not C
done C
a C
very C
good C
job C

returning C
capital C

shareholders C

just C
really C

Thus C
, C
the C
expenses C
are C
only C
allowed C
if C
a C
taxpayer C
is C
itemizing C
deductions C
, C
rather C
than C
taking C
the C
standard C
deduction C
and C
Due C
to C
tax C
reform C
, C
for C
tax C
years C
2018 C
through C
2025 C
, C
miscellaneous C
itemized C
deductions C
that C
must C
be C
reduced C
by C
2 C
% C
of C
the C
taxpayer C
's C
adjusted C
gross C
income C
- C
which C
is C
the C
category C
into C
which C
the C
hobby C
expenses C
fall C
- C
have C
been C
suspended C
( C
are C
not C
deductible C

. C
Thus E
, E
for E
those E

, E
there E
is E
no E
deduction E
at E
all E
for E
hobby E

, E
and E
any E

will E
be E
fully E

But C
because C

suspended C
, _
she E
will E
not E

forward C

As E

the E

a E
follow-on E

more E
in E

in E

, E
we E
were E
able E
to E
raise E

$ E

then E
a E
subsequent E
$ E
3.5 E
million E
through E

With E
that E
in E

our E
GMV E
declined E
to E
$ E
98 E
million E
from E
$ E
127 E
million E
in E
the E

period E
last E
year E
. E
The C
main C
reason C
for C
the C
low C
GMV C
was C
because C
we C
had C
to C
continue C
to C
scale C
back C
investments C
in C
marketing C
and C
inventory C
, C
which C
resulted C
in C
the C
decline C
in C
a C
number C
of C
buyers C
and C
orders C
. C

Our E
total E
revenue E
decreased E
to E
$ E
31 E
million E
due E
to E
decrease E
in E
orders E
from E
approximately E
$ E
91,000 E
to E
$ E
82,000 E
, E
and E
a E
decrease E
in E
total E

, E
which E
includes E
both E
new E
and E
repeat E
buyers E
from E
approximately E
62,000 E
to E
56,000 E
. E
We C
believe C
the C
main C
factor C
for C
the C
declines C
in C
buyers C
, C
